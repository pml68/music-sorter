# A simple music sorter made with Python

A scirpt, that runs through a specified folder's songs, then puts them into their album's folders.

It's made to be used with [spotyDL](https://github.com/spotDL/spotify-downloader).

## Usage

Install dependencies with **pip**:

```shell
pip install pytest-shutil mutagen
```

Enter the correct folder path (41th line), and run the script (**DON'T** use python3):

```shell
python main.py
```

### Why I made and publicated this?

- Basically I download music a lot with [spotyDL](https://github.com/spotDL/spotify-downloader), so I made a script that organises them, so my media server can find them easily.

- Might be useful for anyone out there.
